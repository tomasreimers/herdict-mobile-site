# Herdict Mobile Site

## About

This provides almost identical functionality to [Herdict Mobile Reporter](https://github.com/berkmancenter/herdict-mobile-reporter) for those who can't/dpn't want to download the app. 

## Specs 

The site is almost completely client side with the exception of one ~36 line php script used to make cross site requests. Please feel free to port that script to whichever language you want.

## Technologies

The site uses jQuery mobile as its framework.
